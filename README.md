# Smart Helmet using Arduino

A **Smart Helmet project** designed for safety. It ensures that the rider:  
1. **Wears the helmet** before starting the bike.  
2. Is **not drunk** (alcohol sensor).  
3. Alerts in case of an **accident** using a vibration sensor.  

This project can be extended with **GPS + GSM** modules for accident location tracking.

## üìå Features
- Helmet detection using switch sensor.  
- Alcohol detection using MQ3 sensor.  
- Accident detection using vibration sensor.  
- Buzzer alert for unsafe conditions.  
- Can be integrated with **ignition system** of a two-wheeler.
